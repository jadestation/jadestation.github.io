<p> I didn't really do anything very interesting today! I played Fallout New Vegas all morning (I've only just started it) but it kept crashing. :( About an hour ago I thought to myself "it would be funny to start a website", so I started a website. Yesterday was a bit more interesting. My dad was in town. We went out for lunch and I bought nail polish, tights, a pin and a Radiohead poster. Woo! </p>
