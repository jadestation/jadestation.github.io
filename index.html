	I didn't really do anything very interesting today! I played Fallout New Vegas all morning (I've only just started it) but it kept crashing. :( About an hour ago I thought to myself "it would be funny to start a website", so I started a website. Yesterday was a bit more interesting. My dad was in town. We went out for lunch and I bought nail polish, tights, a pin and a Radiohead poster. Woo!

	Today was the beginning of my work week (I currently work Tuesday through Saturday) and work went well! I priced and sorted a lot of things. After work I went to a sort of family outing with my christian relatives. I offered a high-five to an older family friend while leaving and he asked me "don't you want a MAN handshake?" to which I awkwardly, cleverly responded "I'm not really into that I think". We shook hands anyways and I was right, I wasn't really into that.
