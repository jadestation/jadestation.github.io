<h2> About Me </h2>

Hi!!! I'm Jaiden (they/them). I'm 18 years old. I play guitar somewhat competently and have a few musical projects - the main one is called Tesereve. I really enjoy music and stuff!! Yeah!

	I didn't really do anything very interesting today! I played Fallout New Vegas all morning (I've only just started it) but it kept crashing. :( About an hour ago I thought to myself "it would be funny to start a website", so I started a website. Yesterday was a bit more interesting. My dad was in town. We went out for lunch and I bought nail polish, tights, a pin and a Radiohead poster. Woo!
