<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Welcome to JADESTATION!! </h1>
<div style="text-align:center;color: #1D2A40;font-size: 12px"> <i> <b> At some point in time, this will be the coolest website EVER. I do not think we are anywhere near that point in time. </b> </i> </div>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> 
You've finally arrived. To where, exactly? Well... to the SWAGGIEST website on the internet, of course!!
<br> <br>
This is a place where I will talk about whatever the hell I want!!!!! JADESTATION will be constantly expanding as I become less horrible at HTML. For now it just consists of a homepage and a journal which I will try to write in every day. JADESTATION is still sorta a secret, by the way, so don't go telling all your friends about how cool this place is quite yet (I know it's soooo tempting!)

<h2> About Me </h2>

Hi!!! I'm Jaiden (they/them). I'm 18 years old. I play guitar somewhat competently and have a few musical projects - the main one is called Tesereve. I really enjoy music and stuff!! Yeah!

You'll get to know me better later though. /threat
